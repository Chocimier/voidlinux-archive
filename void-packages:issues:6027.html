&gt; forcing some other method like github or a self build platform is not better.
I'd like you to substantiate your opinion although it seems you just don't want to spend energy into fixing this problem.

No you can not, it won't be merged.

I just received a notification email triggered by Toyam Cox.
He said `No you can not, it won't be merged.`. But, I cannot see his comment here.
Can I interpret it as an agreement that void-packages do not force people to use only email addresses for contact information?

Some mail accounts allow disposable addresses to be created, so you can del=
ete them if they get too much spam. I've had to change my email address bef=
ore to get rid of spam, and that's a real time consuming nuisance. Publishi=
ng email addresses online is totally outdated and insecure. Anywhere this h=
appens results in spam being received and it still ends up in the spam box =
and wastes time checking it isn't something important. Sometimes genuine em=
ails go in the spam box too. Often these emails are dangerously deceptive p=
hishing or fraud, I know people who have had to contact the police and clos=
e bank accounts as a result of 'spam', it is no joke. Git Hub hides mail ad=
dresses but be careful not to use it to sign in to other sites, as they som=
etimes reveal your Git Hub email and then yes, spam is the inevitable resul=
t. Using a website with a contact form protected by a captcha is a good way=
 to allow user feedback and seems to be totally spam free for me so far, bu=
t xlint won't accept anything except an email address in the field.
My favourite spam was the one supposedly from the scantily clad Russian gir=
l who wanted to get to know me better, not that I answered, but few are tha=
t entertaining.
