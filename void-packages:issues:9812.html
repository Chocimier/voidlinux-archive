Thanks @Duncaen!
I tried both `pam_rundir` and `elogind`  and, out of the box, neither seems to set `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`.
Do you think they should? Or should sway depend on some new virtual package "xdg-base-directory" implemented by two "xdg-base-directory-elogind" and "xdg-base-directory-pam_rundir"?
Or... am I getting void linux wrong (hey, I'm new here!) and it's actually ok for a (non-mainstream) package not to work out of the box?

**Closing this issue now**: sway is currently quite experimental and it's f=
ine if it doesn't work (plus, they are refactoring anyway:  swaywm/sway#139=
0).
As for `pam_elogind`, @Duncaen, I can confirm that the module is set to be =
loaded in my `/etc/pam.d/system-login`, but still after log in `XDG_RUNTIME=
_DIR` is not set and no `/run/user/$(id -u)` directory is created.
From `man pam_elogind`:
&gt; [...]
&gt;
&gt; On login, this module =E2=80=94 in conjunction with systemd-logind.servic=
e =E2=80=94
ensures the following:
&gt;
 &gt; 1. If it does not exist yet, the user runtime directory /run/user/$UID i=
s either created or mounted as new "tmpfs" file system with quota applied, =
and its ownership changed to the user that is logging in.
&gt;
&gt; [...]
My guess is that it doesn't work because on this virtual machine I'm playin=
g with a super-minimal install and I need some other package on top of elog=
ind:
```
$ xbps-query -m
base-system-0.112_3
elogind-234.4_1
grub-x86_64-efi-2.02_1
```
Do you see any value in me investigating this or can I just forget about it?
(ie: I'll just create my own `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` since I ~~hate~~ don't care =
very much about pam, but I'll gladly look into this if you smell it could l=
ead to improving the distro).
