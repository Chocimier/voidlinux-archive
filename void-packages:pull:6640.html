You made several mistakes with these contributions.
1) It's not something we care about
2) It isn't substantial in any way
3) None of your commit messages were well enough formed for inclusion.
4) Would have just been a commit to confuse the package history.
5) Again, we just don't care. We don't even mention it in package reviews.

I think any contribution large or small should be welcomed. Having all existing templates conform may not seem substantial but for someone writing new template(s) it is quite useful. For example if I look at another template I take that as an example for the one I'm writing. Having all templates be as close to some consistency as is possible is good not bad.

@Duncaen this helps to understand Void philosophy.  Good to read that there's flexibility.
