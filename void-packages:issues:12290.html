@alekseyt for you to fix: use a staticly linked version from https://repo.voidlinux.eu/static/

Bumping common/shlibs in the case of glibc updates would work too, or #4666

I would try static XBPS but unfortunately XBPS install is blocked by another issue, seemingly WSL-related (user namespaces not implemented or something). This image i'm using was not prepared by me, it's some image from dockerhub, i think it's this one: https://hub.docker.com/r/voidlinux/voidlinux/ .
Although i'm confident installing static XBPS would eliminate solibs errors, yes. I'll try to check this when WSL issue is resolved (probably not anytime soon).
