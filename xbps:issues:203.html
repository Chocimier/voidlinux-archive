@Duncaen Thanks for the tip. Would it be possible to add this to the usage message?
Something line:
```
Usage: xbps-uchroot [-b src:dest] [-O -t -o &lt;opts&gt;] &lt;dir&gt; [--] &lt;cmd&gt; [&lt;cmdargs&gt;]
```
This could be of some help to people not used to this convention. For instance, Arch Linux's `arch-chroot` does *not* support `--` to separate command and cmdargs from its own options.

Ah, thanks again. Maintaining tools which could be linked to either musl libc and glibc must be quite a challenge :smile:
