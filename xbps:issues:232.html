Here is the directory being created above by vmkdir -
I was recently using that to make directories and they didn't have restrictive permissions:
vmkdir usr/share/examples/${pkgname}
$ ls -lh /usr/share/examples
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root 58 Feb 26 14:20 audit
So something else must have done that, unless it was like that on the install image.

That's why I have never seen this issue myself then.
etc$ sudo ag UMASK
security/namespace.init
18:                mask=$(awk '/^UMASK/{gsub("#.*$", "", $2); print $2; exit}' /etc/login.defs)
login.defs
67:#	UMASK		Default "umask" value.
77:UMASK			077
My UMASK is not restrictive. I have never set this myself, but I have locked the root account and only use sudo in the single user account. Those with problems often seem to have a root account they use as well, and perhaps they have changed the UMASK manually or unknowingly by installing some package.

Good day,
Is there any easy way to temporary fix this, if it has already occured?

Change permission on `/var/db/xbps/pkgdb-0.38.plist`

And to prevent it happening again, as Duncaen said:
Workaround is to set a less restrictive umask in sudo.
Or you could try to build xbps using his patch set:
Fix pkgdb and files plist permissions with restictive umask. #234
That should be "restrictive" Duncaen, perhaps that's why it hasn't been merged yet, Travis will be unhappy.

Thank you!
Unfortunately, it did not help. It appears that not only `/var/db/xbps/pkgd=
b-0.38.plist` was modified, but pretty much every file int the directory.
I've compared to the remote machine, where the `xbps-query` works from user=
 and and got the following result:

```
After setting the correct permissions to the `/var/db/xbps/pkgdb-0.38.plist=
`, nothing changed. I tried changing it for the other files too and screwed=
 up a little, so I ended up removing the directory alltogether and creating=
 a new one from root.
Seems to be working now, but I will definitely try a different umask for su=
do, as I use it on a daily basis.

It wasn't only the files, it was the permissions of the directory itself, ie "." (dot, the present directory). If you look carefully at the earlier posts you will see the difference.
