okay, this is probably just a bit simplistic but can you make a "upgrade" for libreoffice-bin, that contains/runs a simple script to install libreoffice and then uninstalls libreoffice-bin - or am I missing something ?

You mean a one-file `libreoffice-bin` that runs `xbps-install libreoffice &amp;&amp; xbps-remove libreoffice-bin` in the INSTALL for the package?

Essentially I guess so, but I have no idea of the impact or advisability, just seemed a simple solution

It depends on if the INSTALL runs inside the xbps transaction or afterwards.
In case it's during the transaction, it would probably fail or even deadlock, because the update tries to remove the currently updated package...
I fear there is no easy way around this essential problem - yet.

You are right. It is lamer and suckier. As well as racier (imagine installing texlive-bin after this) and still does not avoid the essential issues.
Adding a one-time runit script that then removes itself on successful run might work, but seems extremely hacky.

Perhaps an `replace_with` variable in xbps to direct xbps to replace a given package with another.

What's so hard about using `xbps-install -Sf libreoffice` ?

It doesn't get caught in a `-u`

Is there a way to identify obsolete packages or would I have to script that myself?

you mean for installed package on a running system ? `xbps-install -Sun`  for instance. See `xbps-install(1)` man page.
