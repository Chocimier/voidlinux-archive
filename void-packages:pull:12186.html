Just to add: packages using `fcitx4-config` are
* fcitx-configtool
* fcitx-rime
* libfcitx-qt5
I don=E2=80=99t know if three is a large number enough to put it in `cmake.=
sh`, but in my opinion it=E2=80=99s cleaner that way.
And to elaborate some more:
When cmake tries to locate fcitx the found cmake script calls `fcitx4-confi=
g --prefix` to include `FcitxMacro.cmake` (which resides in the same direct=
ory!). That=E2=80=99s what the sed in line 32 in fcitx=E2=80=99s template i=
s for: to look for the file in the same directory. Else `fcitx4-config --pr=
efix` has to be prefixed with $XBPS_CROSS_BASE. But this would cause e.g. f=
citx-rime to install some files under $XBPS_CROSS_BASE which would then hav=
e to be removed again in the template ...
So I tried to find a way with the smallest amount of changes necessary.

The arguments seem reasonable to me while I also don't know if a package count of 3 for which this is useful is sufficient to justify a cmake build style change.

@pullmoll Sorry, just saw your edit: I did some digging and think it is pos=

e build style won=E2=80=99t be necessary :) Need to test that everything el=
se still works. Will report back later today.
Thanks for the nudge in the right direction :)

I think I found a better way to find `fcitx4-config` when cross compiling without modifying the cmake build style:
The problem is that the cmake cross toolchain file is setup to not look for programs under `$XBPS_CROSS_BASE`. This is the right thing to do in general, but in this case `fcitx4-config` (which is a shell script) cannot be found. So the simple solution is to add `$CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH` to the list of paths with which `FcitxConfig.cmake` calls `FIND_PROGRAM` for `fcitx4-config`.
There already is a list of paths defined. One of them is `/opt/fcitx` which is used on MacOSX and to make the sed command less complex I just used this line and replaced it with `$CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`. Now everything works just fine for native and cross builds.

Did some further testing and found that `fcitx4-config` &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; found &lt;i&gt;=
without&lt;/i&gt; the above adding `$CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH` to `FIND_PROGRAM`; I g=
uess the option `ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH` overrides `SET(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_=
PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)` from the cmake cross toolchain file. So I removed=
 the above change. I just have no idea why it didn=E2=80=99t work in the fi=
rst place!
@pullmoll If you can spare a little time, could you please test if this wor=
ks for you? (In case I messed something up.) :)

To clean this up: Apparently, I confused some things while trying out different approaches. `fcitx4-config` is found without any modification necessary. What really does the trick is just to fix how `FcitxMacro.cmake` is included in `FcitxConfig.cmake` (i.e. without invoking `fcitx4-config`). I triple checked and now everything should be ok. Sorry for the inconveniencies.

Hmm.. libexecinfo now fails to build for cross `*-musl` targets for some reason and so trying to build fcitx for e.g. `aarch64-musl` fails here. I have idea what's going on and why `xbps-src` thinks it is not building for a `*-musl` arch when I use `-a aarch64-musl`.

Just tried for aarch64-musl and armv7l-musl and everything is just fine here.

I'm using a glibc x86_64 environment to cross build for aarch64-musl, perhaps that makes a difference. But whatever it is, I think in case of libexecinfo we can resort to specifying the `only_for_archs` list and I would push the PR with that change if all looks ok here.

Same here. Except that it works for me as is. Strange...

Maybe it's related to #12324 but I would not know how. I don't feel like investigating this further, though :)
