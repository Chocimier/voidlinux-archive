3.2.13 Is the version in the latest commit.
However 3.2.9 is the latest. It got a downgrade with this commit.
3.2.9-&gt;3.2.12-&gt;3.2.13

It's black on white:
Here
-version=3.2.9
+version=3.2.12
And the LATEST commit has:
-version=3.2.12
+version=3.2.13
Sorry but in fact this changes the download url to an older package.
So it's a downgrade. Fact is the latest Version IS 3.2.9 and in the latest commit it's 3.2.13.
This commit changed the version from 3.2.9 back to the older 3.2.12 version. The next commits updated it to 3.2.13 but that is still an old version.

*sigh yes it might need a revert for anyone who already had the latest version but anyone who does a fresh install will get version 3.2.13.
For me this was the case and this version had issues.

Oh well. I looked at it more like .90/.13.
Yes you're right.
