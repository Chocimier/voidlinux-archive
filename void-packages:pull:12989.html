I can't find anything related to vim-plug in my system, even after installing normal vim. Where can I find it?

Oh, I get it. It was because I had this mindset that it would be better for files not owned by the user to be handled by the package manager, to make it easy to remember what/where are they installed and remove them. But I yeah, I can do as you advised, and I can close the PR you if want.

I'll close this PR. I realized, due to the nature of packages in Void, it is best not to litter the repositories with niches packages like this.
