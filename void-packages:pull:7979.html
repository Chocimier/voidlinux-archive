I dunno. lpadmin is more or less standard in debian/slackware systems. It is also consistent with the lp and cups group/user.
Maybe we should discuss a bit more this particular case with the @voidlinux/pkg-committers .

While I agree that many systems use the lpadmin group, it is generally used for legacy reasons from when you were running both lpd and cupsd simultaneously and desired to manage them with the same group.  Since cups can fill the function that lpd once had, and since we have a general policy of not altering the upstream configuration of upstream packages, I would prefer to have cups run as cups:root and be managed by users in the cups group.

@the-maldridge https://github.com/apple/cups/blob/b94f7488e861c3119037efdf08257749fcce06b8/config-scripts/cups-defaults.m4#L236 many system uses lpadmin because cups expects to found that group in its system groups. What instead we have is the root and the sys group that are too generic to represent the lpadmin.
We are not altering the upstream config, but instead we are forcing lpadmin when lpadmin is not already installed on top of the distro.
