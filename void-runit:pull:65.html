I really think this is overkill, as proper logging services are already
supported by runit. as part of sv-helper I include rsvlog which is meant to
be symlinked as &lt;service&gt;/log/run, and it allows some handy configuration
of svlogd. Take a look and let me know what you think. It's what i've been
using for logging with runit services for &gt; 8 years.

&gt; vlogger(8) is a alternative to logger(1), by default it sends messages

&gt;
&gt; The main reason to replace logger(1) is, that logger only connects once to
&gt; the syslog socket in default mode and puts all messages into the void if
&gt; syslog is not running at the time.
&gt; logger(1) has a new --socket-errors=3Don mode which would work, but some
&gt; void uses don't use syslog at all and in this case the log service would
&gt; constantly restart.
&gt;
&gt; As a bonus vlogger(8) looks for /etc/vlogger and if its executable it
&gt; just executes it and is replaced by it.
&gt; This can be used to avoid syslog and just write all logs to files with
&gt; svlogd(8) as example without having to edit all log files for each
&gt; service.

&gt;
&gt; NAME
&gt;      vlogger =E2=80=93 log messages to syslog or an arbitrary executable
&gt;
&gt; SYNOPSIS
&gt;      vlogger [-p priority] [-t tag]
&gt;
&gt; DESCRIPTION
&gt;      By default, vlogger reads lines from stdin and sends them to syslog.=
  If
&gt;      the file /etc/vlogger exists and is executable it is executed with t=
ag as
&gt;      only argument and replaces vlogger.
&gt;
&gt;      If vlogger is executed as a log service for runit or another daemont=
ools
&gt;      like supervision suit it uses the service name as default tag.  As
&gt;      example if vlogger is linked to /var/service/foo/log/run it uses foo=
 as
&gt;      default tag.
&gt;
&gt;      -p priority
&gt;              The.  priority can be facility.level or just facility.  See
&gt;              FACILITIES, LEVELS or syslog(3).  The default is daemon.info.
&gt;
&gt;      -t tag  Defines the openlog(3) ident which is used as prefix for eac=
h log
&gt;              message or passed as first argument to /etc/vlogger.

&gt;
&gt; EXIT STATUS

`rsvlog` does not support syslog, which we currently use on void.
I don't see how 100 loc .c can be overkill for something like this. ;)

I found a couple more issues with vlogger in its current state.
It was possible for tag to be uninitialized.
Symlinking vlogger to foo/log/run didn't work as expected, because
runsv doesn't use an absolute pathname when running the service.
Instead, it changes to the service directory and executes ./run.
I fixed them both, on the vlogger branch of CMB/void-runit.

@Duncaen can we go ahead and merge this?  Sounds like you may need to pull back in some changes from @CMB first though...

I'd like to open the can of worms here and ask if this can be an OSI recognized license instead of cc0.  As I've learned recently cc0 is incredibly hard to deal with for US based contributors in certain states.

@Duncaen good point, I'd somehow missed that entirely.  As that's a separate issue, we can handle it in another thread.  At this point I've got no remaining requests for this before merge.
