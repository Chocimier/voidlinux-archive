PR https://github.com/voidlinux/void-packages/pull/3979
@t0b1nux (or someone else familiar with void packaging system), if that is not a big trouble, could you reopen that PR and update the checksum and version? I checked with @Duncaen and that PR seems good to go.
If need be, please take a look at lttng-tools and lttng-ust that were recently ported to Alpine Linux (musl-libc):

Thank you @Vaelatern for quickly providing the port! I have successfully built CoreCLR master 100% with 0 patches on Void Linux x86_64 musl variant.
```sh
# clone
git clone https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr
# build
coreclr/build.sh
# test
coreclr/src/pal/tests/palsuite/runpaltests.sh $(pwd)/coreclr/bin/obj/Linux.x64.Debug
# one test failing, same as Alpine, discussion=&gt; https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/5872
```
