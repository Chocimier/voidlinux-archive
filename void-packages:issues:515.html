@Duncaen the "slightly patcched" is referring to the version of LGPL that qt uses,not the qt itself

What about the way telegram deals with dependencies? It seems to ignore system-wide ones and only use those in `../Libraries`, including big things like Qt

Should we use their binaries or build from source? Note, that if we are going to build from source we should also create templates for the following packages:
`appindicator unity dee libxcb-image libxcb-keysyms libxcb-icccm libxcb-render-util libxcb-util libxcb-sync libxcb-xfixes libxcb-randr libx11-xcb breakpad` and patched Qt
Also note, that for musl libc, crash reporting must be disabled, because breakpad is mostly glibc-oriented
