Bohoomil has since released his 2016-03-29 patchset, which applies just fine against freetype 2.6.3. Unfortunately, the patches fails to apply to fontconfig 2.11.1, while applying successfully to 2.11.94.
Can we update fontconfig 2.11.94? I know it's not technically considered "stable" but every other distro uses it as stable, and 2.11.1 was released in early 2014.

OK, *every* distro was a slight exaggeration. :p
And actually, after checking, the majority of the top distros on distrowatch.com seem to use 2.11.1. My bad!

I resolved problem, but I think it's a crutch.

A diff would be more useful to understand your solution.

You rewrite template file in freetype directory using my one and build
package. But it can't work with fontconfig building.
