Looks good so far =F0=9F=91=8D Added a few further ideas though.

I had the idea to use xbps-uchroot instead of chroot, this unshares the m=
ountspace and bindmounts /dev /prov /sys. Unfortunately iirc there were s=
ome issues with it that needed to be fixed in uchroot.

Maybe we can use the getopt/getopts combination we use in xbps-src here t=
oo.

Does xbps-uchroot play nice with qemu-user-static?

xbps-uchroot is actually chroot + unshare. I don't know if there are implications to qemu

I looked into this and it seems that the important options are being mirrored across.  I don't think copying over more options that are already copied over buys us anything.  I certainly don't think the dance that xbps-src does with preprocessing is worth it here.

Can we dynamicly use the number of CPUs in the system? Does this make sense?
And I'm curious: Does running multithreaded xz result always result in an identical file with the same checksum?

setting this to 0 will dynamically use the maximum number of threads.  The problem with this is that it also takes a lot of memory to do this.

I think we should keep that change in our mind, But it shouldn't be part of this PR.
