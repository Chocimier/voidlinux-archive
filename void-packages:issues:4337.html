Thanks Duncaen
It didn't really work because of some cyclic? depenmdencies loop:
```
xbps-install libEGL
SDL-1.2.15_10: broken, unresolvable shlib `libGL.so.1'
cairo-1.14.6_2: broken, unresolvable shlib `libGL.so.1'
libva-glx-1.7.0_1: broken, unresolvable shlib `libGL.so.1'
mpv-0.17.0_2: broken, unresolvable shlib `libGL.so.1'
webkitgtk2-2.4.11_2: broken, unresolvable shlib `libGL.so.1'
xorg-server-1.18.3_2: broken, unresolvable shlib `libGL.so.1'
Transaction aborted due to unresolved shlibs.
```

I just uninstalled xorg and several packages related to it and installed again,
it worked this time. However I found out more relating to another issue I
reported, about the very slow rendering of wire frames by one of my own
apps, xnec2c: with nvidia-libs installed, it renders a lot faster than with
libGL/libEGL installed. This also happens if I remove firmware blobs intended
for the KABINI GPU's, so I think libGL/libEGL don't play well with KABINI
firmware involved. This happens in other distros too, Arch and Debian tested.
