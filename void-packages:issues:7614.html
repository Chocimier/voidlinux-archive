It shows cyrillics correctly but inputting whose with keyboard yields nothing.

This doesn't seem to be specific to cyrillic, it seems to be UTF-8 in gen=
eral that cant be entered.
Also, UTF-8 characters enter something invisible into the searchbar (caus=
es the search results to change), and those "invisible" characters can be=
 deleted like normal characters.
This sounds like a font issue, but if you do "echo =C3=A4|dmenu" you cant=
 select this entry by typing "=C3=A4" - which means that dmenu considers =
those two different characters.
Also, characters after an "invisible" one are likewise not visible, even =
if they are from the ascii range.
Judging from that, its probably a wrong input charset issue, and its not =
displayed because its not valid utf8.
