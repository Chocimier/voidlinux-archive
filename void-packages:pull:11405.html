Perhaps I can help to clarify some requests which @Vaelatern made or rath=
er the policies regarding Void templates and how we believe they should l=
ook like.
If at all possible, avoid `git clone` and try to use releases - is [1.4.5=
.2](https://github.com/actionless/oomox/archive/1.4.5.2.tar.gz) not suffi=
ciently new? And if it isn't, you're cloning 1.4.99 if I understood your =
template?
We generally don't like packages which are not in some definend and repro=
ducible state for anyone who tries to build them locally and `git clone =E2=
=80=A6` has a tendency to break every now and then. I think we even have =
a (silent?) agreement to not accept new `*-git` packages, which means pac=
kages which don't download distfiles but use some RCS to fetch files.
If no releases exist, you should use the git revision of the commit you t=
hink is usable and download the tarball from e.g. the latest commit [fa9e=
b21f69d7ac76e9c673d91b9a7b2ee0b72118](https://github.com/actionless/oomox=
/archive/fa9eb21f69d7ac76e9c673d91b9a7b2ee0b72118.tar.gz).
For going this way our common practise is to define a `version=3D` includ=
ing a date stamp, e.g. 1.4.99.20180128 and also define a variable like `_=
git_hash=3Dfa9eb21f69d7ac76e9c673d91b9a7b2ee0b72118` to be used in the di=
stfiles line like this:
```
distfiles=3D"https://github.com/actionless/oomox/archive/${_git_hash}.tar=
.gz&gt;${pkgname}-${version}.tar.gz"
```
Now if a github (or other git repository's) package contains references t=
o other packages with a specific git hash of their own, download them alo=
ng with the main package using the same scheme. In this case you could de=
fine `_oomoxify_hash=3Dabcbadbadbad...` (find it in the tree) and use tha=
t hash in a second line in `distfiles=3D"=E2=80=A6`.
Finally in a `post_extract()` or perhaps `pre_configure()` function in yo=
ur template move the referenced packages where they are expected to resid=
e.
For an example of a template doing just that [take a look at tracebox](ht=
tps://github.com/voidlinux/void-packages/blob/master/srcpkgs/tracebox/tem=
plate).
Finally a template should never try to optimize for possibly already exis=
ting `git clone =E2=80=A6` directories. You can think of the builders as =
always being in a clean state when a package is to be built. We do everyt=
hing to make sure they are clean, because otherwise no build would be rep=
roducible.
Collecting the necessary info from a package and its submodules is a burd=
en which upstream puts on us by not using released versions of their inte=
grated packages. They all should be slapped around with a large trout =E2=
=80=93 or rather be kindly asked to use a downloadable set of subpackages=
 instead of recursive submodules. Most of them probably would never chang=
e their mind, though, and this is where a packager's job is beginning to =
become tedious... you asked for it :grimacing: =

Alright, thanks for the explanation @pullmoll, I have 1 question though, with this `install` script, which build style should I choose? I cannot find one that fits the needs of this packages(meta is not allowed, configure doesn't fit either because I don't have a `do_build` part and fetch doesn't extract from the start, so that means I'd need to extract all the files myself{possible, but not really clean})?

@tim241 not specifying any build style should be the correct way

As @Johnnynator said: if no build style matches, remove that line from the =
template and write your own `do_build()` and `do_install()` functions. You =
can find quite a few templates w/o `build_style=3D=E2=80=A6` in the reposit=
ory.

I merged it after applying some changes to your template:
+ It's a (shell) script only package, so I set `noarch=3Dyes`
+ It doesn't expect python, but python3, so I modified the `depends=3D=E2=
=80=A6`
+ If a package doesn't cross compile solely because of a dependency, ther=
e shouldn't be a `nocross=3Dyes`, except for cases where this dependency =
will never be cross compilable or is hidden deep in a tree. `python3-gobj=
ect` may some day be available for cross builds and then `oomox` as well.=
+ Changed to install to `/usr/share/oomox` rather than `/opt/oomox` becau=
se Void doesn't like `/opt` (exceptions exist, though)
