@Duncaen
Thanks! I stop, thankfully, before ruining my SSD.... but I also had to delete the stray supervise directory before it worked.
I honestly have no idea how this happened. All I did was to update with xbps-install -Syu. The link and directory could not have been created accidentally, or deliberately, since I had such little knowledge of runit.
Well, all is well that ends well....

I just thought, it may have happened to others but unless they have disk i/o monitoring, as in conky, it might not be noticed.
