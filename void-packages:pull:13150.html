Whoa! `v2.0.0.tar.gz` is more than `2.0 GiB (2,125,832,713)`.
I'll rather wait for some @voidlinux/pkg-committers to confirm this PR can be merged.

Way too big!
For packages of this size you would ideally have a data package as well since this appears to have executables as well as data.

The package is `noarch=yes` so it will be in the repo once.

@the-maldridge the scripts are only as helper scripts to be sourced by th=
e shell in order to render the characters using environment variables (e.=
g. `echo $i_weather_day_cloudy_gusts` =3D&gt; =EE=8C=80).
The package is &gt;2G because all fonts are installed by the package. I coul=
d split it (one subpackage per font) but it would be ~45 subpackages and =
make `nerd-fonts` as only a meta-package. Not sure if this amount of subp=
ackages would be any problem, but I'm sure users with low bandwidth surel=
y will be happy with this. What do you think?

I am infinitely more likely to entertain this package as a meta-package with subpkgs than as one giant package.

FWIW the resulting xbps file is 256,314,456 bytes "only" :)
IMO we can merge this hoping the builders can handle it.

I'm with @the-maldridge here.
Also I'm not sure about any licensing issues.
