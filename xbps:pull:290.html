## Profit
On my hardware, time of processing [meta-type package with dependecies of marble5](https://github.com/Chocimier/void-packages/blob/autoremove-benchmark/srcpkgs/autoremove-benchmark/template) reduce by 7 times, and most of that reduced time is installing dependencies.

## How does it work?

Instead of building deptree, then checking its all components, list of packages to remove (`array`) is used as queue for BFS graph traversing. Speedup comes from the fact, that if some package is still needed, all its sub-deptree can't be removed too, and processing that sub-tree is futile.
The other change is early exit from revdeps loop. When one revdep of X package is not orphan, it is clear that X is not orpan too.
Changes in test does only update order in which packages are selected for removal.

## The catch

Above example shows some strange thing: `libcolord` run_depends do not contain `eudev-libudev`, but `eudev-libudev`'s revdeps contain `libcolord`. In effect `eudev-libudev` happens to not be removed. Is it a typical case I should care for?
