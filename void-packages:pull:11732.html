@voidlinux/pkg-committers should we merge this now or rather wait for the `*-musl` builders to catch up?

I vote wait for musl builders.

The qt5-5.10.1_4 build for x86_64-musl seems to be broken. qt5-declarative-5.10.1_4.x86_64-musl.xbps cannot be extracted. It seems it was corrupted when packaging.
Yet another revbump?

It seems kdesignerplugin cross building always fails.
I'll give disable_parallel_buil=yes a try or otherwise we need to make cross builds depend on the host's kdesignplugin and the contained /usr/bin/kgendesignerplugin.

I can't solve this problem. I tried what I could imagine might help and failed.

I will also run some local builds and see if I can find a solution, I wonder how this package has slipped since I tried to build everything for aarch64 before I opened the PR.

I found a hacky solution. I don't know if the results are usable, though.
I think we should create a separate subpackage `kgendesignerplugin` with just the binary to use for cross builds, because I think `kdesignerplugin` for the host pulls in a lot of unused stuff.

The kde5 meta package should include the `plasma-*` stuff only for no-cross as it is now, because we have the unsolved problem of plasma-framework reporting:
```
CMake Error at src/declarativeimports/core/CMakeLists.txt:29 (add_library):
  Target "corebindingsplugin" links to target "Qt5::Gui_GLESv2" but the
  target was not found.  Perhaps a find_package() call is missing for an
  IMPORTED target, or an ALIAS target is missing?
