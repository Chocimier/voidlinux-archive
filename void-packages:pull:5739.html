In what way does it look wrong, because it is an absolute path? The issue is that the speech-dispatcher headers are in /usr/include/speech-dispatcher and not /usr/include. Currently the qmake scripts for mumble fail to take this into account and the compilation fails.

That seemed to work. However I'm not sure if and how environment variables from the shell are processed by and available within qmake. Since the package cannot be cross-compiled in it's current form I also couldn't test it. The speechd header file is only included in a single file so patching that file to include the header file in the correct path might be another way to solve this. I amended the commit to do that, the path stays relative this way.
