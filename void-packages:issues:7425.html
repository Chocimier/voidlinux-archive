- mumble-dbg do not help
- I followed instructions on mumble wifi, taken the sources from their github, added the missing dependancies and compiled and it works with musl. My configuration line is:
qmake CONFIG+=no-g15 -recursive main.pro
Compilation is done with qt5. The Void template is using qt4 and may be should be updated.
Thanks for your help

@herveq it can't be updated to qt5 yet since the last stable release only supports qt4.

Also 'no-g15' doesn't make a difference because it only affects Mac and windows builds.

Does not matter ! Take your time...as long as you are aware of the issue!
I had to set no-g15 because I got an error with a missing file.
