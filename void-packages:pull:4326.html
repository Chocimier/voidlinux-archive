```
$ xbps-query -Rp shlib-requires -s libgettextlib-0.19.7.so
gettext-0.19.7_1: libgettextlib-0.19.7.so (https://repo.voidlinux.eu/current)
$ xbps-query -Rp shlib-requires -s libgettextsrc-0.19.7.so
gettext-0.19.7_1: libgettextsrc-0.19.7.so (https://repo.voidlinux.eu/current)
```
looks fine to me. @voidlinux/pkg-committers please verify and feel free to commit.

`xrevshlib gettext` returns `fcitx` but it turns out `libfcitx` depends on `libgettextpo.so.0` so I am not concerned.
