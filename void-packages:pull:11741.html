5b15f49  xmonad(-contrib): fixed minor template issues
</section><section id="post3">

xmonad-contrib/template:
**libXrandr-devel** and **libXft-devel** are missing from makedepends=""
pkg-config is missing from hostmakedepends=""
use xlint (xtools package) to get rid of template issues.
Also you may want to squash your commits so the people with push privileges have an easier time.

I will do that, no problem there, and I've implemented most of the fixes - but my problem is that for some reason the `.xbps` file is generated without any binary (there's just a LICENSE, xmonad.1 and the standard xbps files).

The funcion
 ```
do_install()
```
is wrong!
As is now it only install license and manpage, you would do this in function
```
post_install()
```

@gspe While that was quite a stupid mistake, I'm afraid it didn't quite fix it... xbps-src tells me that it fails to install `ghc-8.2.2_1` as a dep., and that `less-530_1` is broken (because?) of an unresolvable shlib `libpcre.so.1`. The whole transaction fails because of the last message.

Hi, I did some research and I've found that you can't use haskell-stack style to build apps like xmonad.
Stack tool lack of `--prefix=` option so it doesn't copy libraries and other things when you use `stack install` command.
See this bug report [Add stack build --prefix option](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/848)
I'm trying to make a template using `runhaskell` command maybe we can try to do this together if you want

While I would like to help, I only have minimal experiances with building haskall packages, and I was just hoping that  `stack-install` would take care of it...
