@Gottox
That why i wanted to update the original source url, i'm not sure how you prefer to handle this diff, i can see with the project owner to make a new tag, and at this point only update source url with the real new release ?

Since we don't have epochs yet I don't think we have a clean way to deal with a new release without a new number. Upstream making a new tag would be best.
