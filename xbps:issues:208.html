@Duncaen Ah that's a good point, and almost was part of my question in a previous edit. I guess that a bootstrap script should have its own way of verifying the key (and perhaps asking the user upfront, even if the actual bootstrap will be done at a later time).

We should always ask this question. Regardless of -y.
Nevertheless we should test for isatty and asume "no" if stdin isn't a tty. This prevents automatic scripts from hanging.
For automatic installs, you should place the key in the right directory (/var/db/xbps/keys) before starting any installation.

Thanks for all the good points, I've updated my bootstrap script to fetch, verify and install the key files itself.

Hi!
While adding support for creating Void Linux chroots to `directory-bootstrap` of image-bootstrap (in https://github.com/hartwork/image-bootstrap/commit/ff46179698babcea0c51e52e6ffb2dac8782b08e) I came across this very issue (and happily confirm the advertised workaround to be working).
I would like to vote for not proceeding with key import unasked for security *while* keeping `--yes` fully non-interactive, as advertised. In my mind, aborting with an error that `--yes` requires the key put in place, would work best: It would allow calling tools to pass a tty that they need for themselves, without applying tricks to call xbps in non-tty mode. Thanks!
PS: @Gottox, we just had a quick chat at the Void Linux assembly at 34c3 on that topic.
