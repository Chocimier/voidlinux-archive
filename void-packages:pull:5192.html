Many times people 'cheat' with things like nopie to get the build to pass.
Or they get the build to pass but got something else wrong.
This is why it must be reviewed.
But in this case I think the template is right but (I've tested it and) the upgrade process doesn't work at all.

@Duncaen That's reasonable. But isn't there some way to provide the end user with the information that package is deprecated? Maybe a new version so during the system update xbps will tell that this package has been replaced?
The problem is that even if people do upgrade from 'lemonbuddy', their config will almost certainly not work, due to the number of changes in syntaxis and behaviour of the panel. It is close to a new product, in my opinion.
@Vaelatern Can you provide more information on the error, please? I think it will speed up the process and help a lot.

Perhaps the solution is to provide a subpackage for lemonbuddy that just has a "lemonbuddy has been depreciated in favor of &lt;pkgname&gt;" or no message just do the switch.
Error: I build and install lemonbuddy. I then -Su. This does not show up. I then install this, old one is not removed.
The upgrade path sucks.

@Vaelatern So, if I ask author to treat it as a completely different package, instead of update. this will be satisfactory and the package might appear in the repo faster?
Because I personally really miss this package and would be glad to see it in the repos, even if it is not update of lemonbuddy, which, as I have mentioned, will most probably not work with the old config files.

`depends` line is redundant. See https://travis-ci.org/voidlinux/void-packages/jobs/195969639#L917-L935.

The above build options are missing the description. Example: `desc_option_i3="Enable support for i3"` and so on.

Is there any progress on getting this merged?

I don't think it will be merged, to be honest.
They want the author to make lemonbuddy upgradeable to polybar, which is not going to happen, due to a variety of reasons.
There is a more up to date template on his github and it builds perfectly (except on musl). You can also try to add it to VUR.

It's not always pleasant to be proven wrong, but today is one of those exceptions.
Thanks for pulling it.
Now I can finally stop building it with every update.
