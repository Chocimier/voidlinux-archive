Can one of @voidlinux/pkg-committers confirm this?

@Vaelatern I confirm: using `xinit` or `startx` as non-root user, I can't launch the X server.

I'm quite sure it is working for me. I will check later today.

I forgot to update the thread. Working for me. See https://github.com/thypon/dotconfig for the xinitrc I'm using

@thypon I don' think @dan-santana 's question was about how to use a custom `.xinitrc`

Even with a .xinitrc, still have the same issue. This was what I was trying to use at first:
```
#!/bin/sh
exec bspwm
```

On my system x86_64-musl, using the default `.xinitrc` (from `/etc/skel/.xinitrc`):
````
#!/bin/sh
#
# ~/.xinitrc
#
# Executed by startx (run your window manager from here)
if [ -d /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d ]; then
  for f in /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/*; do
    [ -x "$f" ] &amp;&amp; . "$f"
  done
  unset f
fi
# exec gnome-session
# exec startkde
# exec startxfce4
# ...or the Window Manager of your choice
````
when I run `startx` it doesn't work...
Oddly enough, if I do the same in my **glibc** system, it works. :confused:
Is it different for you @thypon ?

I only have glibc system, I have not tried with musl.

I also couldn't test it on musl, only glibc where it didn't work. As the results seem varied, in the next days I'll create a script to build a minimal Void Linux setup from scratch that reproduces the issue.
