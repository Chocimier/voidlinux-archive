Hmm.  I'm not sure what is going on.  I tested with the following kernels:
```
4.9.61_1 = Wireless works
4.9.62_1 = Wireless does not work
4.9.65_1 = Wireless sometimes work
4.9.65_2 = Wireless works
```
Attached are logs for each kernel version.  I don't really see anything different between .61 and .62 and .65 other than the wireless not working (the device is seen, but wpa_supplicant never connects).
I'm not sure why 4.9.65_1 (which has the CONFIG changes) works on one RPI 3, but not another.  4.9.65_2 (which does not have the CONFIG changes) always seems to work however.
