Just found out I messed up with the commits on my end...
Trying to squash the two into one now...

Hmm, only i686 and x86_64 glib packages build correctly... Looking into it...

The culprit seems to be [`rpmatch(3)`](http://linux.die.net/man/3/rpmatch) which musl libc does not have.
A simple, non locale aware replacement could be written to accept e.g. "yes", "y", "no", "n" as valid strings returning 0 for negative and 1 for affirmative strings, or -1 otherwise.
This could be patched into `main.c` itself enclosed in `#if !defined(__GLIBC__)` like this:
```C
#if !defined(__GLIBC__)
int rpmatch(const char* response)
{
    if (!strcasecmp(response, "n") ||
        !strcasecmp(response, "no"))
        return 0;
    if (!strcasecmp(response, "y") ||
        !strcasecmp(response, "yes"))
        return 1;
   return -1;
}
#endif /* !defined(__GLIBC__) */
```

So should we not build this for musl then?

@WilliamO7 I think @Duncaen and @pullmoll are discussing the ideal workaround so we can build it for musl.

@Duncaen I tend to agree, while musl has `setlocale()` and we could use `gettext-devel`...
Then `gettext()` could used to query the localized strings for e.g. `"yes", "no", "^[yY]" and "^[nN]"` compare their translation to the response.
Just a thought. For now the hack should suffice.

@pullmoll Would it be correct to now `makedepends` on `musl-rpmatch-devel` for this package?

Yes, I think `musl-rpmatch-devel` could now be used.
Instead of trying to patch `configure`, or even `configure.ac` and/or `Makefile.am` in case you wanted to add `automake` and `libtool` to hostdepends, it should be sufficient to have a global scope `LIBS=-lrpmatch` or perhaps `LDFLAGS=-lrpmatch`.

Sigh, still doesn't build on musl (and yes, I did move the include up and build again)...
I would look for another file that includes rpmatch, but I really do not have the time right now.

I'll probably take a look later this afternoon.

@WilliamO7 LMK if the package works for you. I didn't take the time to test the results.
