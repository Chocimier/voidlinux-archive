From conversations with @bougyman there is desire to manage the servers a bit better than "here are some servers".  Adding kerberos into ssh is one of the technologies that would make that substantially easier, though I suppose we could do a custom build with a vopt for void infrastructure if it is deemed too heavy for base.
Seems kind of silly though that void infrastructure wouldn't be using mainline void packages though.

It's about 10 megabtytes for mit-krb5 + dependencies, so it's not oppressive. It would not be useful to a live CD, but it would be nice to have it present in a package for a developer who wants to change login methods.
I support it so long as it's a build option.

We could switch from openssh to dropbear in base.

Please keep openssh in base.
These issues are mainly build issues, not that base-system is too big.

I also am weary of anything that isn't openssh.  The others just don't feel "battle tested" enough.
