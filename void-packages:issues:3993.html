This matches my experience. Anybody else know if the line has been acting correctly? @Duncaen you have noticed this behaviour as well, when I asked for help on starting dbus programs, if I recall correctly.

dbus-uuidgen is run in its runit service.
Thanks

Err sorry, I meant that `dbus-uuidgen` is already in its INSTALL script.

@the-maldridge INSTALL scripts are run before or after the unpacking phase.
- in `pre` the action is run *before* unpacking.
- in `post` the action is run *after* unpacking, and runs in the *configuration* phase.
xbps separates those two phases. If you are setting XBPS_ARCH or XBPS_TARGET_ARCH, the configuration phase might be skipped.
Take a look at void-mklive/mkrootfs.sh for details.

While it is in the INSTALL script, it is not actually generating the uuid.  This is reproducable in a new void install quite readily by trying to install dbus, starting it, and then trying to use something that depends on it like awesome.  On request I can build a VM and get the exact error, but it appears to be something generic out of dbus.
