So what's the reason for this? I've splitted this to avoid extra deps while building the live images... what was your reason?

os-prober needs grub-mount now.
i guess grub-mkfont is the only program that could be split for deps?

I'm not sure the live images needs os-prober tho, perhaps it should not be a dependency of grub?

Shall we revert the split then, and make os-proper depend on grub-utils again?

I will move grub-mount to grub, this is cleaner. fuse is just a small dep.
