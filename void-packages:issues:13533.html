Can't reproduce. What is your _any_  i18n pack?
</section><section id="post2">

I tried four different packs:

* *thunderbird-i18n-en-US*
* *thunderbird-i18n-en-GB*
* *thunderbird-i18n-pt-BR*
* *thunderbird-i18n-ru*

It did not work. I tried launching thunderbird with --UILocale set to a different locale (matching the i18n packs installed) and still nothing shows up.

The only line that shows up in console when launching in it is this:

`[calBackendLoader] Using Thunderbird's builtin libical backend`

I understand something is wrong with my system, but I can't pinpoint what it is. For more info, here is my fontconfig config file:

```
&lt;?xml version='1.0'?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM 'fonts.dtd'&gt;
&lt;fontconfig&gt;
	&lt;alias&gt;
		&lt;family&gt;serif&lt;/family&gt;
		&lt;prefer&gt;&lt;family&gt;Liberation Serif&lt;/family&gt;&lt;/prefer&gt;
	&lt;/alias&gt;
	&lt;alias&gt;
		&lt;family&gt;sans-serif&lt;/family&gt;
		&lt;prefer&gt;&lt;family&gt;Liberation Sans&lt;/family&gt;&lt;/prefer&gt;
	&lt;/alias&gt;
	&lt;alias&gt;
		&lt;family&gt;monospace&lt;/family&gt;
		&lt;prefer&gt;&lt;family&gt;Fantasque Sans Mono&lt;/family&gt;&lt;/prefer&gt;
	&lt;/alias&gt;
&lt;/fontconfig&gt;


```

Did you try to backup your thunderbird profile and start with a fresh one?
</section><section id="post4">

Yes, I tried removing the profile many times and it didn't work. I tried even launching thunderbird with a fresh profile with the --UIProfile flag. It also did not work.

I also tried altering, and even removing, my fontconfig file and it seems to have no effect on it.

Please try to start thunderbird via

`LANG=C thunderbird`

Does that work?

Yes, I tried using `LANG=C` and it did not work.

I did run thunderbird using `strace` and I copied over all search matches to "font" (and a little bit around it to provide context): [here](https://ghostbin.com/paste/524gk).

Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out what was the problem behind this, so I backed up my data and did a full reinstall of the system. It works as intended now. Not sure why it was that way before.
With that said, I apologize for this. I'm closing this issue. Thanks in advance for the help.
