I think the problem with this is, that it isn't supported by busybox modprobe. @chneukirchen @Duncaen what do you think?

Thanks for your comment!
AFAICT, busybox has no "kmod" command applet, so this script wouldn't work anyway?

Any feedback on my previous comment? Do we need to worry about Busybox support here?

Ideally we don't want to lose support for something that works already.  That being said its been a few years since I tried to bring up a system on busybox so I can't vouch that it works at the moment.
Assuming that this script already doesn't run on a busybox system, I have no other issues.

I note that Busybox modprobe actually does accept "-b" even when the blacklist feature is disabled, as in Void's package.

Summing up:
- Busybox has no `kmod` applet, so `kmod static-nodes` is unlikely to yield useful output there.
- Busybox `modprobe` accepts `-b`, even when the blacklist feature is disabled.
Any other reason why this can't be merged?
Thanks!

How about finally merging this one?
Cheers!

Ah, get this in for now. If we ever support busybox, there may be other things to consider too.
