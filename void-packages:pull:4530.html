I've done this because I think that build_style=gnu-makefile is overriding the Makefile flags and I don't know other way to make it work.

As I see it compiles only on glibc x86_64 and i686. Is it again problem in the template?

@xinterer If it's a matter of dependencies not being present, and not actual technical reasons, then do not at all put `nocross` or `only_for_archs` at all. Such things only matter if the software itself can inherently not be cross-built or whatnot.

Guys, thank you very much for the help and the explanations!
So, what remains to be done to the template if it builds only for glibc x86_64 and i686? Its builds, right?

Please do as @Duncaen said and make this consistent with other packages. `license="ISC"`

You can remove `pandoc` from the `hostmakedepends` and add these lines to global:
```
case "$XBPS_TARGET_MACHINE" in
	*-musl) # Does not have pandoc
		;;
	*)	hostmakedepends+=" pandoc"
		;;
esac
```
The man page is still installed, just not built from the source for *-musl.

Also `python` can be removed from `hostmakedepends`. It isn't required AFAICT.

Well, I've seen that the template with the changes from @pullmoll  was added and the package are already in the Void repo. So, I assume that this pull request should be closed...
Thank you again, I learned a lot of things here.

Yea, I made a mistake when I accidentially pushed my own (wrong) version of a template for mergerfs.
I reverted that commit and decided to take your template, apply the fixes and push it.
I hope it works for you @xinterer
