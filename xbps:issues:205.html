@Duncaen Thanks, I will upload new logs asap.

Hmm,
```diff
-+ sudo arch-chroot /home/miki/proj/qemu/archlinux/mnt xbps-install -yd syslinux
++ sudo xbps-uchroot /home/miki/mnt -- xbps-install -yd syslinux
[..snip..]
-[DEBUG] [repo] `//var/db/xbps/https___repo_voidlinux_eu_current/x86_64-repodata'
-[DEBUG] [repo] `//var/db/xbps/https___repo_voidlinux_eu_current/x86_64-repodata'
-Unable to locate 'syslinux' in repository pool.
```
Maybe `xbps-install` forgets to store repodata *in the chroot dir* when used with `-r` option? Just a guess...

@Duncaen Good catch! I will try the static xbps binaries, and perhaps I could leave a comment about the Arch PKGBUILD in the AUR.
Thanks a lot for looking into this.

@ackalker I'm the maintainer of aur/xbps-git, and I believe I just fixed the PKGBUILD. Could you please rebuild it, test again, and report back?

@oatberry Thanks for the quick reply! Our actions have crossed, I made the exact same change as you did and rebuilt `xbps-git` package. Succes, the problem no longer occurs.
[Here](https://gist.github.com/dd966d5f29db1d8f377a08e1eae33492) is the (hopefully final) output log of the repro script.
@Duncaen Please feel free to close this issue if you wish, sorry to have bothered you with what turned out was an Arch Linux packaging issue.

I don't think this issue is solved yet as the options should not be interpreted as relative paths. Thanks for pointing this out :)
