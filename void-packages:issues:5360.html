@Duncaen: Interesting.  I created a patch from that Openwall discussion[*]

then patched and built webkit with xbps-src.  The result is that JavaScript appears to work in surf and that xombrero segfaults on startup.

I think I'm having a similar issue on x64. Any idea what the appropriate change would be in the [webkit2 source](https://webkitgtk.org/releases/webkitgtk-2.14.4.tar.xz)?
I am trying to get it working with the [surf-webkit2 branch](http://git.suckless.org/surf/tree/?h=surf-webkit2) (xbps-src [template](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/svenper/abb0438f77319bea4d33d9ce8456f26e/raw/34e278670f2ae30e82e5b5062eb04b97ab708550)) and currently everything seems to be working except JavaScript.

I tried bumping `musl`'s stack size from the default all the way up to `glibc`'s 8MB, as per https://github.com/voidlinux/void-packages/issues/4147. It fixed _some_ JavaScript, but, sadly, not all of it. Some sites that are okay on `glibc` still don't function properly on `musl` (tested on surf and Midori).

@Duncaen no, rebuild did nothing at all. I find that in most cases apps that are affected by stack problem are usually fixed without need for rebuilding them (e.g. file managers crashing when thumbnailing certain files stops immidiately after reinstalling `musl`).
P.S. (offtop) oh my god this thing build for 3 goddamn hours! And I wondered what Suckless people meant by "replacing WebKit with something sensible".

@E100Beta rebuilding `musl` with a larger stack size has no effect for me, even after rebooting. Did you do anything else?
```
$ ps xc | grep -e surf -e WebKit
 5999 ?        Ssl    0:07 surf
 6016 ?        Sl     0:10 WebKitNetworkPr
 6019 ?        Sl     0:59 WebKitWebProces
$ cat /proc/{5999,6016,6019}/limits | grep stack

@svenper Only _some_ javascript starts working after rebuilding `musl`. **A lot** of it is still non-functional, sadly (like, I now can actually log into vk.com (which is the most complex sites in terms of javascript I frequently visit, so I test on it first of all), but some buttons that trigger background content loading or displaying some previously hidden parts of the page are still not working). I can't tell exactly what functionality is fixed by it exactly, I'm not too experienced in js :(

I'm having the same problem with x86_64 musl libc , using typecatcher (a python GTK based client for downloading Google fonts).   It works fine within an lxc container with the same kernel on Ubuntu 16, but with Void Linux musl x86_64 I'm getting the following error:
"Message: console message: undefined @0: RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded."
I'll try rebuilding musl with the larger stack size and see if that has any effect.

Still working this issue:
- recompiled musl with the bigstack option (no effect)
- recompiled musl with the debug symbols so i could see where TypeCatcher was segfaulting...
- looks like the segfault is in /usr/lib/libjavascriptcoregtk-3.0.so.0.16.19 somewhere  (which is part of the webkitgtk-2.4.11_5  package)
- i recompiled webkitgtk-2.4.11_5 with an 8MB stack to see if that fixed the issue, but haven't actually tested that fix yet.   will post here if there's any progress.

if this is still a problem, the Gentoo patchset works fine for Alpine Linux (after some minor adjustments). it _should_ apply cleanly to 2.20.3, not sure about later versions.

Thanks @ds6 ! I'll try it locally with an updated `webkit2gtk-2.20.3`.
I'd be glad to see it fixes the musl problems.

There is also an [upstream issue regarding this problem](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=187485) maybe someone should tell them about the gentoo patch (I don't have an account in their bugzilla instance).
