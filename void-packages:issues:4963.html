@mstraube, do you plan to push your kde applications to main repo?

Would be cool to have also **Gwenview** (Image Viewer) app from _KDE Apps_:
https://www.kde.org/applications/graphics/gwenview/

As for now, there is no alternative to view photos/images in KDE Plasma desktop... Now I'm forced to use Chromium :smile: 

Even better would be **digiKam** (https://www.digikam.org/) which has **ShowFoto** as part of it.

I've submitted a PR for Gwenview in #10110 . I also looked at digiKam but that software is way too complex, I wouldn't be comfortable maintaining that package.

@Hoshpak Thank you for Gwenview! Really appreciate it. Hope to see it in repos soon :+1: 

About digiKam, yes it's pretty complex. It is fully featured photo management tool, with loads of fancy features. Anyway more important is Gwenview for basic photo viewing.

Just for information: All packages from my kde-applications branch are in the repos now, deleted the branch.
