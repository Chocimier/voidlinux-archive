p7 reported in IRC that libixion11 and liborcus11 still need to be rebuilt, I created #7524 for that. Besides that, two more packages still seem to link to python 3.5:
```
python3-editdistance-0.3.1_1: libpython3.5m.so.1.0 (https://repo.voidlinux.eu/current)
python3-regex-2017.06.23_2: libpython3.5m.so.1.0 (https://repo.voidlinux.eu/current)
```
python3-regex was removed from void-packages in 9130426b346c9a76d0f1a112f36c36cb7829caaf , the other one in 6771d706a35272b9d00a98dcb45654733b7b782e . Perhaps these should be removed from the repository to ensure they won't cause confusion in the future.

&gt; python-tornado depends on python-backports_abc which has 3.5 stuff?
`python-backports_abc` is needed for Python &lt; 3.5
&gt; pytthon3 alternative gets lost during update? (even needed?)
It's a `xbps-alternatives` issue. That said, the `python3` alternatives group is a legacy of the old `python3.4` package when we could have multiple python3.x versions at the same time. OK to remove now.
&gt; lots of obsolete python3.4 packages can be removed now, 10 months after python 3.5
It's on the roadmap. Hope 10 months are enough.
&gt; python-ipython_ipykernel fails to build on aarch64 builder (but not locally oO)
Cannot reproduce. I guess is like the `ctop` package, it fails to detect the default locale/encoding and fallback to C locale.
&gt; p7 reported in IRC that libixion11 and liborcus11 still need to be rebuilt, I created #7524 for that.
Both weren't update on purpose. They're no longer needed since 700b682a5472228d5b0813e0ff108dbe19725a6b and should be removed instead.

I have some problem with Python3 on ranger too:
`zsh: /usr/bin/ranger: bad interpreter: /usr/bin/python3: no such file or directory`
Is there any solution how to solve that?

Yes, just set the alternative again.
