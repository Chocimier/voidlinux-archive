I'd strongly prefer to build ashmem and binder using dkms (as in anbox upstream), instead of polluting our distro kernels with this stuff.

Polluting: I LOLled. I don't think we can consider 4000 self contained sloc pollution in a 20 million sloc Linux kernel codebase. But you should ask the kernel guys that thought android binder should be merged in mainline kernel, maybe.
Btw it is not possible to pursue what you proposed since anbox binder/ashmem are only synced with latest ubuntu supported kernel and they don't even compile on recent kernels. Otherwise, one possibility is a Linux mainline patch to made these modules loadable, or maybe you could simple `rm /dev/binder /dev/ashmem` if you consider them harmful.

How big are those modules?
dkms is only a workaround for licencing issues. imho it's not the right tool to split up 'bloatness'.

They are not modules; they need to be compiled into the kernel image. The anbox modules are modified to compile outside the main kernel image.
