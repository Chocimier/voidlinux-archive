There! Ok, wasn't that much better than just closing? I had to make a custom gdb to have python-bindings, but it was so long ago that I didn't remember anymore.
And system update doesn't do anything, all I had was qt5 packages, subversion (for the reason already mentioned) and python. I had the ysstem updated yesterday. The most important is the index. After that dependencies come along.
