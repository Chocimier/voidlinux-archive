Great, I didn't know that. I will refrain.  This one might be significant since the previous release was 3 years ago.  It's not urgent or critical afaik fwiw but I am using 1.4.2.
Good to read there're things that're automated.

@The-Fred I did what I could to update it, see [PR#6745](https://github.com/voidlinux/void-packages/pull/6745). The Arch [PKGBUILD](https://git.archlinux.org/svntogit/community.git/tree/trunk/PKGBUILD?h=packages/heimdall) was helpful.

@Duncaen perhaps `CONTRIBUTING.md` could mention the autogenerated reports. it's not obvious that this type of issue isn't needed.
