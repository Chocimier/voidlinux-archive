@djames1 Please don't ping random people.  Your PR will be reviewed when time is available.
That being said, this looks like its okay to merge; even if its doing scary things to the linker.
The one change I want is the license to come from somewhere that isn't the void-packages tree.  Presumably this is in the source some where; please use that copy.

@the-maldridge the source tarball does not contain the license at all, however their github repository does. That is why I included the license file from their git repository. There are multiple files in the tree that include a license file in the ${FILESDIR}, examples being: discord, graphviz, btsync, ksh, shadow, hfsprogs, evilwm, lsof, mksh, and jenkins.

Attempting to lecture a maintainer on package policy tends to decrease the number of people willing to review your PRs...
If the license is at a fixed location you may use xbps-uhelper fetch to retrieve it in a post_build() from a URL based on the git tag just before using vlicense to install it.  This is the preferred way to do it as if you version it in xbps-src and the license changes, it is very likely that the package will no longer carry with it the correct license terms.
As far as the packages above, we have several packages with -git versions as well and yet policy precludes git packages entirely.  Not everything is perfectly in compliance at all times.

@the-maldridge I wasn't trying to come across as lecturing you. I was just wanting to make 100% sure that I was not being misguided in any way by reading other packages for guidance. I apologize if my comment sounded harsh, that was not my intention at all.
The git tag for release 0.0.1 does not include a license file either. When they release 0.0.2, I will change the package to pull the license from the tarball, as their changes since 0.0.1 add a LICENSE file.
Thanks!

Duly noted.  As soon as https://github.com/AdelieLinux/gcompat/issues/2 closes please make sure the license is removed from our source tree and the correct path is used.
As this makes changes to the way the linker works I am going to request one other maintainer from @voidlinux/pkg-committers replies with a shipit before merging.

You can just add the license url to distfiles. distfiles and checksum are space separated lists. It requires a tiny bit more magic to make work, but it's all documented.

`PREFIX` and `DESTDIR` definitely redundant.
As for the linker changes, I'll need to review further. Other maintainers: go right ahead and review yourself, I'm not going to review it today.

To give some insight onto what exactly happens here, this package creates a file called libgcompat.so.0 in /usr/lib. This file is a shim that basically translates some glibc functions into musl linker functions.
It then creates a symlink to that file with in the location that the glibc linker would be in if this were a glibc system. Since that file should not exist on a musl system, and all the binaries already on the musl system should be linked against musl's linker, there should be no linker issues.

Currently working on building glibc and musl for all arches so that way I can add all musl arches to the case statement.

My two cents: I believe that our musl port should be musl only. So even if we merge, there must be a rule that we only merge stuff that links directly to musl and must not use gcompat.
personally I would prefer to use a containerization framework like snap or flatpak for those apps instead.

<h5>Michael Aldridge at <a href="#post15">Tue, 19 Sep 2017 06:50:29 +0000 (UTC)</a></h5>
I think that is a good idea, there should be a linter check that makes sure this isn't in any package's depends line.
While I like the idea of using containerization and chroots, I also have some software which aren't available in such formats and aren't good candidates for packaging due to commercial reasons.

This gcompat can still be useful to bootstrap compilers etc.
And ofc for users directly.

@Vaelatern when I try to pull LICENSE file from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdelieLinux/gcompat/master/LICENSE I get the following error: `ERROR: gcompat-0.0.1_1: unknown distfile suffix for LICENSE.`
After looking at https://github.com/voidlinux/void-packages/blob/master/Manual.md I see that the file extension needs to be in the extension list there. Is there another way to do this?

@the-maldridge that seems to have worked. PR should be ready for review again.
Summary of changes:
- Added support for all musl archs that we currently support
- Modified template to fetch LICENSE from AdelieLinux's repo
- Changed do_install to post_install
- Added more make_build_args and make_install_args to fix errors in build I didn't catch originally.
