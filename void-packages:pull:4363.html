Do you mean sqlite for example? Trojita has got `qt5-webkit` as a dependency and this package already depends on `sqlite`.

Oh sorry, I see. Do you wish that I add `qt5-plugin-sqlite` as a dependency in order to provide a default? I think experienced people could still force the installation of a different plugin but I don't want to break a philosophy or something similar.

I just added `qt5-svg` in the meantime which is also required (for icons) but not automatically added as dependency.

IMO installing `qt5-plugin-sqlite` as a default or fallback doesn't hurt. It is small and `sqlite` itself will already be installed on many systems.

Yes, it requires just 17KB and as I mentioned earlier, `sqlite` is already an indirect dependency.
