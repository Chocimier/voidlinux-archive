@Duncaen
&gt; Maybe we can find a solution to make binary perl modules are depend on the libperl version instead of &gt;=, this happens every time perl is updated.
Well, I don't know how the library interacts with the modules, but it seems this is the cause. Depending on the exact version should list all dependent modules once you change the line libperl.so.5.26 in common/shlibs?
