There's already an FAQ on the wiki. Do you think they could conflict?

+Extra options can be passed to most services using a `conf` file in the service directory.
+
+```
+$ cat /etc/sv/sshd/run
+#!/bin/sh
+ssh-keygen -A &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1 # Will generate host keys if they don't already exist
+[ -r conf ] &amp;&amp; . ./conf
+exec /usr/bin/sshd -D $OPTS
+# echo 'OPTS="-p 2222"' &gt;&gt;/etc/sv/sshd/conf
+```
+
+### Cron
+
+Void Linux comes without a default cron daemon, you can choose one of multiple cron implementations, by installing the package and enabling the system service.
Mention how any cron agent can be enabled just by enabling the one symlink (via alternatives)?

+
+# Introduction
+
+# Installation
+
+Void Linux provides a dialog based installation script, which can be used for most basic setups.
+The script however does not work for slightly more specific setups, in this case you should use the manual installation method.
+
+The following features are **not** supported by the installation script:
+
+* LVM
+* Luks
`* ZFS`

+
+Other syslog implementations like `rsyslog` and `metalog` are available in the package repository too.

+## Changing the default shell
+
+The default shell for users can be changed with the `chsh(1)` tool.
+
+```
+$ chsh -s /bin/bash &lt;user name&gt;
+```
+
+A list of available shells can be retrieved with the `chsh(1)` list command.

I don't think multiple FAQs would conflict. Like an A/B test, one would eventually win.

&gt; +To use the kernel module options you can create a file like `/etc/modprobe.d/alsa.conf` with following content.
+
+```
+options snd_usb_audio index=0
+```
+
+Alternatively using the alsa configuration file `/etc/asound.conf` or the per-user configuration file `~/.asoundrc` to set a different card as the default.
+
+```
+defaults.ctl.card 2;
+defaults.pcm.card 2;
+```
+
+#### PulseAudio
+
+PulseAudio depends on `dbus` and `ConsoleKit2` after installing pulse you need to enable the corresponding system services.
That's not true, pa does not depend on ConsoleKit.
&gt; +defaults.pcm.card 2;
+```
+
+#### PulseAudio
+
+PulseAudio depends on `dbus` and `ConsoleKit2` after installing pulse you need to enable the corresponding system services.
+
+```
+# xbps-install -S alsa-utils pulseaudio ConsoleKit2
+# ln -s /etc/sv/dbus /var/service/
+# ln -s /etc/sv/cgmanager /var/service/
+# ln -s /etc/sv/consolekit /var/service/
+```
+
+To get PulseAudio working correctly you need to make sure that your session is started with a ConsoleKit seat and a dbus session bus. Some display managers do that for you, in other cases where you just start a Xorg session with `startx` you have to start them from `.xinitrc`.
+
I'm running pa and elogind. consolekit isn't even installed. I'm actually not sure if a loginmanager is needed at all if the permissions are correct.
