@filcuc seems to have fixed `DOtherSide` upstream, the patch isn't necessary anymore and the standard package now works as it is.
The standard package now installs the following files:
- libDOtherSide.so.0.6.3
- libDOtherSide.so.0.6 symbolic link to libDOtherSide.so.0.6.3
`nimqml` has been patched to use libDOtherSide.so.0.6 on Linux.
The cross compilation still need to be fixed though, certainly in another pull request, if someone else have an idea on how to fix it.
