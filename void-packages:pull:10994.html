cc @Duncaen please review the busybox.dotconfig changes. I won't merge this without a :+1:

So this is more or less :-1: from you... Then let's perhaps request the full blown busybox.config as an option selectable by a `build_options="everything"` or similar and stay with the set we had enabled previously otherwise?

I mostly enabled all that was by default as with the old config file, the build failed.

I did a cleanup for the config file to be as close as possible to the current one, adding some new options and removing some old ones. I hope I'm not missing anything important.
