Ok, I got mkinitcpio working now. However, I have to use the `initramfs-4.5.5_1.img.old-dkms` image, the other one freezes Xorg for me.
The trackpad is still not working though, I believe it's because of these kernel messages:
```

[  103.768673] udevd[677]: Unable to EVIOCGABS device "/dev/input/event11"

```
And here's the relevant parts of xorg.log:

I have also tried manually configuring Xorg to no avail.
@Pizza-Boy Any ideas?

Same problem here.
Regenerating initramfs with mkinitcpio does not solve the issue for me.

Hello,
i have the same problem.
The touchpad of my mid-2012 macbook pro is identified as a pointer instead of a touchpad.
Is there any solution at the  moment?
Using mkinitcpio did not work for me.

I managed to get the touchpad working by including the bcm5974 driver when building the initramfs.
I still get the 'Unable to EVIOCGABS device' error for the keyboard, but it works nevertheless.

Hi @d-kraus, what steps did you take to include the bcm5974 driver during the initramfs build? And was this using dracut or mkinitcpio? I can try and replicate it to see if that works on my end.
</section><section id="post7">
<h5>d-kraus at <a href="#post7">Fri, 02 Sep 2016 07:56:12 -0700</a></h5>
I just did
`sudo dracut --force --add-drivers bcm5974`

<h5>Pizza-Boy at <a href="#post8">Fri, 02 Sep 2016 08:00:03 -0700</a></h5>
ah, alright. I'll give it a test today and see if that works on a fresh installation.

I used a similar method to @d-kraus (although I just added the bcm5974 driver to a conf file for Dracut so it's loaded each time the init file is generated). That appears to fix the issues.
I have run into some other issues with `xf86-input-synaptics` and `xf86-input-mtrack`, namely, that you have to remove the synaptics driver to load the mtrack driver and trying to remove the synaptics driver throws up dep errors with `xorg` (which woudl be resolved by having mtrack installed). And some issues with forcing the removal of synaptics. Should I open a new issue for those?

Same problem for me on Macbook5,1
Fixed with:
`sudo dracut --force --add-drivers bcm5974`
