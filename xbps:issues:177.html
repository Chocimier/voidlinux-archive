@Duncaen if you try to build 0.51, its configure simply does not require what it should (`libarchive`).
As per static builds: thanks, I know about them, but I am reporting here about the status of master which is not buildable on a common Linux system (while I think it should?)

@Duncaen you're right, I had apparently ignored the configure error and went on to use the pre-existing Makefile.
The only improvement I can suggest is to **not** version in git the Makefile, as I thought it was generated by configure in first place (while configure didn't, as it had failed with the libarchive error).
