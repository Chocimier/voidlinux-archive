No special reason. IMO, this implementation is easier to extend in case there's a need to add more variables to the list.

Please at least use `$()` instead of `` to denote a subshell.

I'm not sure if passing through environment variables into the chroot is a good idea at all. Explicit configuration via an XBPS_PROXYS variable or similar in /etc/conf keeps the chroot independent.

I'm work behind a proxy, set XBPS_PROXYS in /etc/conf dosn't work.
This PR works well.

I neither claimed that this PR doesn't work nor that setting XBPS_PROXYS currently works. I just don't think that unconditionally passing through environment variables is a good idea.

What about using a sudo-like approach where you can define the list of the variables you want to passthrough in a conf file? (`env_keep` in `/etc/sudoers`)
