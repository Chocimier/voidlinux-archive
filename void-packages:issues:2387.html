palemoon developers refused to support musl, so void-packages maintainers refused to include palemoon, too.

They also refuse to support current gcc versions which makes it unfit to be included in a rolling release distribution.

Void packages lots of stuff that refuses to support musl ( == proper standards).
In contrast to openbsd-wip, which only distributes build instructions, (this is why the linked issue isn't reasonable) we ship binaries. That means the threats that were done to the linked repository actually apply to Void if we would add palemoon with system libraries.
