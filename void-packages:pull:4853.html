Please add a comment explaining your reasoning for the restriction (about those being the only arches close to possible on the macbookpro).

Not sure why you still have a `do_install()`, can you either remove it or explain why it is necessary?

Alright, I've managed to really goof up the commits on this package somehow, and I don't really know how to clear it.
If necessary I could just delete this branch and push the changes again in a new pull request.

The way to fix is likely to rebase on voidlinux/void-packages master branch

Looks like the rebase fixed everything.

Sorry for the confusion, I'm still figuring out git.

The `make install` does not honor the value of `$DESTDIR`. It installs into `/usr/bin` instead of `$DESTDIR/usr/bin`. See https://travis-ci.org/voidlinux/void-packages/jobs/164653827#L661

Alright, I think I've got it installing to the right location. Whole thing was a real pain in the ass because the Makefile doesn't have any way to change the destination directory by default--just patched it in myself through `sed` commands. Let me know if there's an easier way to do that.

Corrected the file to use `vbin` and `vinstall` instead--think this should be simpler.

So after doing some testing on my system, there appears to be a bug in the 1.9.1 version of mbpfan that causes a buffer overflow error when running tests, doing other things, etc.
It looks like it's been reported and fixed upstream in the master git repository, but I didn't want to use that because it seems that stable versions of software are preferred.
I know the flag that needs to be changed for gcc (_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 to _FORTIFY_SOURCE=1), but I'm not sure what the easiest way to do this'd be. Alternatively, we could pull the master repository (but that's not a stable release, technically), which should have this issue patched out, I think. Or maybe write a patch for it.

Alright, setting `nopie` to something turns off the hardening features that cause the issue and make the program install correctly. Would it be alright for a non-hardened package to be installed, or should we pursue a different avenue?

Hardened packages are, of course, preferred, but if it's too much of a hassle I guess we can live with it.
There's always a chance that someone takes a look and improves things, once a package is merged.

I'm sure that someone who knows C++ could write a patch integrating the changes upstream, but I'm not that guy (because I know nothing about C++).

This implies you need a `conf_files="/etc/mbpfan.conf"`
This line should also be `vconf` unless you have a reason.
