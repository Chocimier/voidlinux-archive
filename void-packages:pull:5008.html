It pulls in the statically built essentia extractor which is only available for i686 and x86_64. The project wants/recommends using their binary over building your own to provide consistent results.

If you really need to install one of two binary packages, you need to add a case/esac statement to set both, distfiles and checksum for the binary.
I'd still prefer to have this built from source. At the very least this binary package should have a `-bin` extension, if some day the same package is built from source. This already happened for some packages in Void, e.g. lightzone and libreoffice.

Okay, leave this for now and I will play with a local build from source.
