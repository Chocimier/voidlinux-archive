Thanks for the tip, that worked. ack also works and searched faster than my find command, although it still used all available CPU - it also looks like cgroups can throttle CPU usage of processes.

And the search completed quietly in the background without switching the fans to high speed.
mupdatedb seems to do an incremental update so is much more efficient than gupdatedb.
It occurs to me now that the faster boot time indicates that BTRFS has improved the HDD data transfer speed. This has resulted in commands that were previously limited by disk access to run faster and now they are limited by CPU performance, so I should adjust to this new performance balance.
Therefore this isn't really a bug so I'm closing it, but I  think that findutils would definitely be improved by using nice in /etc/cron.daily/updatedb like in the mupdatedb equivalent, so it wouldn't block other desktop processes. Possibly maximum CPU usage could be throttled using cgroups, but some users might want it to run at maximum speed though.
