@Duncaen i think you've also hit the x86/bro issue in chromium too. Do you remember the fix?

Good news! Thanks @ebfe. With this set of patches we can update the monolithic build to 5.9.0.
For the split modules I couldn't get cross building to work, i.e. everything depending upon `qt5-base-devel` is failing with wrong compiler, C{XX]FLAGS or L{,D}FLAGS.

```index: added `qt5-webengine-5.9.0_1' (x86_64-musl).```
Updated the branch.
@pullmoll i used a sledgehammer to disable gold on musl in `files/musl-patches/musl-no-gold.patch`, I'm sure someone who understands the qt config stuff can come up with something better.
Oh, and i take the pink unicorn hoof :)

I integrated your patches in my branch. Next I'll be trying to solve cross building issues.

Closing because qt5-split does not seem to be easy enough for me to finish (read: I can't get it working for cross building qt5).

IIRC I tried 5.8.0 some time ago. I'd say let's wait for 5.9.2 which is said to be out soon.
Then we need to take some care to get the beast built for all targets (avoid ENOMEM :-)
