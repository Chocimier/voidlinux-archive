And this PR adds a lot of artifacts to the repo that surely can be downloaded from elsewhere.

Its all from the package over at the AUR, which has had no licensing problems and has now become endorsed by the project on their home page.
The artifacts could be taken from the aur if that is better?

The license still makes me nervous, and is unclear.

ibrokemypie, take a look at HikariKnight's Runescape client for Unix. It's GNU licensed and supports both, Runescape 3 and Old School Runescape.

@ibrokemypie so where does the AUR license these other files for redistribution?

@Vaelatern AUR lists the license as "custom" and downloads the .jar directly from OSBuddy's website. OSBuddy is not open source software and they offer a premium model that has a monthly cost. It's an unofficial, third party client for the game. However, most players prefer OSBuddy as it offers multiple features the official client does not have.
I've used the client I linked but I'm not very familiar with the technical side. It's made by a Runescape moderator and is completely open-source and somehow adjusts the official Runescape client to work on Linux.
Again, I'm not completely sure how Runescape or the clients work on a technical level but I guess they act like a browser, connecting to the Runescape server, downloading necessary files and running the game.

I still think having OSBuddy packaged would be a good thing, the more the merrier, so I will contact them and ask permission to redistribute in binary form through XBPS

@ibrokemypie, I don't know but it's packaged for other distributions. It seems to be the most ["official"](https://support.runescape.com/hc/en-gb/articles/206659489-Linux-Native-Clients) Linux client for Runescape.
If OSBuddy is to be packaged, remember to mark it for the non-free repository as it's closed source software.

@all going to just leave this until developers get back and update when/if they do. In the mean time, going to do rsu-client since we need a bit of runescape in whatever wrapping :)

@ibrokemypie At this time, the official stance is that the license is iffy at best.  If no other maintainer has comments on this in the next 2 days, I'd suggest closing this PR given that we really aren't comfortable merging this at this time.

License is iffy, there are too many random artifacts, and it's nonfree anyway.

I understand why this was not merged, but can we see a package made for the client mentioned by @Jazqa? It looks like it should be fine. I just found this thread while searching how I can play OSRS on Void.
