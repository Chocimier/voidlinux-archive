I guess anybody is interested in it currently, and I'm more using Rust than .Net currently. SO I don't really plan to maintain this. That's why I close this PR. Feel free to reopen a new PR from your own fork (of void-packages, ofc) if you want it to be merged.

@mjeanson, is there anyone at lttng using void linux? I am using Void Linux musl (Void Linux also comes with glibc). I guess musl variant would require the same patch you did for Alpine/aports.

Yes, you'll need the same patches as those in Alpine for everything to build and work properly on Musl.

Nope. Those patches were upstreamed.

Even Alpine doesn't have them anymore.

@mjeanson, the lttng-ust v2.8.1 package has landed in the xbps repos (as you yourself upstreamed all the musl patches for 2.8.1 :smile:) But you are right, for lttng-tools, however, we would require your patches.
@Vaelatern, Note that for dotnet, we just need user-space lib (lttng-ust). However, it would be nice to have lttng-tools for kernel event tracing etc. available for the platform as Alpine now does with @mjeanson's benign patches: http://git.alpinelinux.org/cgit/aports/tree/testing/lttng-tools. :)
