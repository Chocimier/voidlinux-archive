I suspect you may be right. I'll change it to nocross. Not sure how to actually test it though.

I have a commit on top of this that fixes cross compiling.  It just needed a few extra packages to be available during build and then it was fine.  The build came out fine with no errors, but short of pulling out a pi I can't confirm that it actually works.  Given that our standard of "working" for new packages has been green builds on Travis, I'm merging this as it sits.
Quite an enjoyable program, I have it running in the background at the moment.
