I've suffixed it with _generic_ as in `agetty-generic` It's not intended for direct activation, but to make a derived service (`agetty-tty1`, `agetty-ttyS0`, etc.).
Furthermore, I said it's very useful as a user service because that's the most common use case, but I can imagine it being used for IRC bots or something alike. The behavior of `ii` (opening channels as FIFO files) makes it great for that purpose. It would make sense running it system-wide.

Ok I understand your point. Is sad, providing user services using the package manager itself is very convenient (I come from GuixSD where this is being done). In fact, I was preparing another PR for bundling a `runsvdir-generic` system service for enabling user services (`runsvdir-jmi2k` for example).
I'll close the PR (again!) because it seems like it needs more thinking and discussing beforehand. Maybe it can be reconsidered in the future if packaged user services become a thing.
What do you think? Should I open a follow-up issue to discuss it?
