@Duncaen, thanks! I have just tagged it at version 2.1. Do I need to update the template and make a new PR?

I couldn't locate the upstream link for that specific package in any supported format. I looked at some of the other hunspell packages and noticed different sources too.
I haven't had the time to dive into the more complicated setups with xbps-src yet, but I suspect that it's possible to use the upstream main package with all the languages and then build from that.
I also looked at the Debian package which also seems to be put together differently https://packages.debian.org/da/stretch/hunspell-da. So I just decided to volunteer at keeping that package updated on Void.
Regarding the license - should be comma separated, I already had that in, but was told to remove the commas, I cannot remember who said that.
