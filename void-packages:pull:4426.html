&gt; -	vcopy src/utlist.h usr/include
&gt; -	vcopy src/utstring.h usr/include
&gt; -	vdoc doc/userguide.txt
&gt; -	vdoc doc/utarray.txt
&gt; -	vdoc doc/utlist.txt
&gt; -	vdoc doc/utstring.txt
&gt; -	vlicense LICENSE
&gt; +
&gt; +	for files in src; do
&gt; +		vcopy src/$file usr/include
&gt; +	done
&gt; +
&gt; +	cd doc/
&gt; +	for docs in *.txt; do
&gt; +		vdoc $docs
&gt; +	done
So make these loops, if they are actually supposed to be every file, just two lines:
```
vcopy src/* usr/include
vdoc doc/*.txt
```
and this will be ready for merging.

When I use vdoc doc/*.txt, ocorreus this error:
```
=&gt; ERROR: uthash-2.0.0_1: vinstall: cannot find 'doc/*.txt'...
=&gt; ERROR: uthash-2.0.0_1: failed to run do_install() at line 140.
```
This is motive is in commit.
```for files in src; do
              vcopy src/$file usr/include
done```
