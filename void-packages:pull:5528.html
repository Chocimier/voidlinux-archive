No, you cannot. Removing any single one will break the install. That is why they are in there. Curiously enough with the most recent version of void-packages even more hostdepends (autoconf, m4, automake, libtool) are needed.

Does the build try to use its own tools? Or does it use ours?

It uses exactly the tools the developers of zcash intended for it to. I am not aware of any script that is pulling its own version of m4/automake/autoconf or libtool but if it did there would likely be a reason for it. At the same time, this are listed as hostmakedepends for literally thousands of other programs in the repo (in the case of automake), why is my package held to a different standard than any of them?

This is now obsolete, several newer versions of zcash have been released.
