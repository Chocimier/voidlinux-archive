The latest version of lel (v0.1) was released in 2015.
Since 2016, farbfeld support has been added along with some updates, but a new version hasn't yet been released.
I will try to contact the main developer to see if they can tag a new release with these changes.
About btpd, we have been discussing here #10749  that it is better to ignore this package, since its current state is useless.
