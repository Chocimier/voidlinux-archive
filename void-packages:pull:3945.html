It probably worked because `gstreamer1` got pulled in by `gst-plugins-good1` et al.
The manpage one has to generate with Sphinx is real minimal and kind of useless.  To provide documentation inside the package we could move all the `doc/*.rst` files to /usr/share/doc or generate the HTML/man.  Or keep the hint to the online docs in the INSTALL.msg.  Dunno about that.  What do you think?

Let's do all the documentation options if it helps people.

Any way we can stick with just one version of gstreamer with this?
