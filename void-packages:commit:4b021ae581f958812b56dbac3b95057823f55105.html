Oops .. sorry! :)
I don't know if umurmurd is meant to be run as a service, but probably yes.
If you like, you can take the package ownership and modify as you think may fit.

Perhaps we should add another label similar to WIP to indicate that someone is taking care of a request?

I am sitting here waiting for another qt5 build, that's why I hacked up the template instead of twiddling my thumbs. Yea, now that you say it, assignee is perfect for this...
Will you take the package or should I go and try to add user and service?
