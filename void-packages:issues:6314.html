```If a user wants to use the syncthing service for multiple users they would have to copy the whole directory and fix the supervise symlinks. (Otherwise the two services conflict and only one really starts)```
@Duncaen syncthing doesn't really support multiple users without running under different ports. This requires another approach entirely.
@go2null huh. that's good to know. maybe we can just install a service as an example that need to be copied by the user.
