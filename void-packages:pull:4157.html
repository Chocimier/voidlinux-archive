I left it out because upstream by default leaves it on for `i686` as per: https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/commit/ff8061cd1d97e99f141b02a7fe36e83f302b909c
That said it could have changed. I'll explicitly enable it.

Well, since that commit is tagged `3.3.5` and we only are on `3.2.6` it could well change in the future.
