I hope it's fixed now, I haven't had had too much experience until now with void packaging, so I'm sorry if this was a bit of a fuss.

@Gottox &amp; @Duncaen I'm really sorry for my improper use of `nopie`
Like @phikal , I am not very experienced with void packaging, but I want to help! :wink:

@Duncaen What did you say about `nopie` ? It's a bad idea for a browser ?
Take a look at these templates: [chromium](https://github.com/voidlinux/void-packages/blob/master/srcpkgs/chromium/template#L16), [firefox](https://github.com/voidlinux/void-packages/blob/master/srcpkgs/firefox/template#L13), and [firefox-esr](https://github.com/voidlinux/void-packages/blob/master/srcpkgs/firefox-esr/template#L14).
All three have `nopie=yes` !
