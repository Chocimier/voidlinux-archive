I tried, but it seems that the Makefile calls `scss` with some options that are specific to it, `sassc` isn't really a drop-in replacement unfortunately. I was going to modify the Makefile to try to make it work, but I read somewhere that that is frowned upon.

We're okay with patches to the makefile that are needed for things like cross builds and the like, but in this case this is an acceptable solution.
