Can you try and merge your makefile patch upstream? Not necessary before the package is merged, but will greatly reduce the burden of maintaining a patch.

@Vaelatern i will try merge my makefile patch upstream.. from my point of view there is no point in doing that. `xkblayout-state` project is not maintained consistently.
