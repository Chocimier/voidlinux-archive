No chromium instance is running on subsequent start -- I'm guessing the log output is only when it first creates the config directory.

Everything's upated -- this is a fresh install. I'm on a Thinkpad X220 with Intel video fwiw.

Bizarre! Maybe there's some dependency one of us has installed that is needed but not listed.

Fascinating!
I'm also noticing that glxgears doesn't work, so this may not be a chromium issue after all. But the way glxgears is broken is slightly different: it always shows a black screen, regardless of what used to be under it.

And fwiw Xorg.0.log seems to indicate that the intel module is being loaded.

Huh. In linux4.8 chromium is at least usable -- in linux4.7 my success rate was 0.

You can disable various features with graphics drivers such as 3D rendering or hardware acceleration. It is usually done via conf files, kernel module options or options added to the kernel command line, and could provide a workaround. Intel are quite good with computers I have observed which might also suggest the real problem is not in the kernel. Most of the graphics stack is outside it in xorg and various rendering libs.
