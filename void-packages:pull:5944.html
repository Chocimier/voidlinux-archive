Looks massive but okay to me. When do we schedule the rebuild?

I'm discard my thunderbird update, can you update the -i18n packages too?

qt5 on aarch64 was solved (builder OOM).
There is an update for libreoffice-5.2.x.y (don't remember the numbers) pending, but this can wait.
libreoffice-5.3.0.3 requires a new version of fbclient (3.x) which has its own issues, read: won't build as is.
As long as the current version builds I'd say: go with it.
