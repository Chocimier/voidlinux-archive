@voidlinux/pkg-committers I have tested these patches across the 4 hardware configurations that are affected and plan to merge on August 12th.  If you have breaking issues that will block this merge.  Please comment as such before the 12th of August.

Go for it. I'd like to build new images and _test_ them afterwards.

I personally prefer to test before merging, but that may be personal preference.

Yea, I was pointing to the last release that included a non-functional X-Server on some systems.
