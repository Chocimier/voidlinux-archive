The initramfs version will require substantially more engineering work to make function.  Turns out dracut was never designed to run arbitrary executables in the initrd, who would have guessed.

It's quite easy, use a second initrd to put stuff into
/usr/lib/dracut/hooks/*/

@chneukirchen See this commit: https://github.com/the-maldridge/void-mklive/commit/d46db26215a59498316416377d8c2fdac6b34a0a
Even though the hook is installed it does not seem to be getting run.  Its also worth knowing that the installer is an interactive process at one point, and at any rate the progress should be printed on screen.  Currently I think its getting redirected to /dev/null.
